# About Me
* Kevin - DCU Computer Science college student. Very interested in full stack development.
* Hi there! I'm a computer science student and open source enthusiast. I love building things and solving problems, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle.

I have experience in a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript and Java and I'm always eager to learn more. I'm also a strong believer in the power of open source software, and I contribute to a number of projects in my free time.
